<h2>The Recipe for Disaster</h3>
<p>It brings me happiness that you have come to this page to learn the recipe for disaster. Quite honestly I think you have formed many
   recipes throughout your life but perhaps you want an <strong>OFFICIAL</strong> method to wreak havoc. Luckily you have come to the right place.
   While I would urge caution in using this recipe for disaster, that will actually be counterproductive as you will soon find out by reading 
   the following necessary ingredients. 
</p>
<h3>Disasterous Ingredients</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Blatant disregard for anybody and everybody</li>
        <li>Unblatant disregard for education</li>
        <li>An absolute disregard for caution and safety</li>
        <li>The unrelenting need to cause chaos and destruction</li>
    </ol>
<h3> Steps in chronological order to cause disorder</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Wake up</li>
        <li>Get up</li>
        <li>Scream as many obscure obscenities as loud and as fast as you can</li>
        <li>Flail your arms around rythmically, almost like in a windmill fashion</li>
        <li>Repeat steps 1-4 as needed. Remember, the goal isn't just to get as many felonies as possible, 
            it's to cause such a disaster that new strange and specific laws <strong><em> must</em></strong> be made on account of
            your erratic behavior.
        </li>
    </ol>

<h4>But Why? What is the purpose of all of this?</h4>
<p>The 2nd Law of Thermodynamics states that Disaster is the name of the game. The Law of Conservation of Mass states that Disaster 
cannot be created nor destroyed. Therefore with this knowledge at hand go forth and wreak havoc with your disastrous tendencies, for it is what the physics of 
the universe declares anyways. Also, while using these educational/science based laws to justify your reprehensible and blasphemous actions, make
sure to not to contradict ingredient #2</p>
